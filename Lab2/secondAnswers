Exercise 2.2

If you print an int before assigning a value to it, the value will be a random large value, either positive or 
negative.

If you print a float before assigning a value to it, the value will change slightly from 4.59135e-41 but stay
around there.

The int gives a random number while the float gives an almost constant value.

Yes, if you try to store a value too large in an integer, the program will not compile.

Yes, it is possible to store a value too large for a float, the program will not compile in this case as well.

The largest value an integer variable can correctly hold is 2147483647.
