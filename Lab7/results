The 26th element is consistent if you input the same values into the array.
If only 1 is input into the array, the 26th element will always be 1065353216.
If only 2 is input into the array, the 26th element will always be 1073741824.
The 10 in front of the number does not change, only the last 8 digits change.

Trying to print the 10000th element of the array instead prints:
Segmentation fault.
According to Wikipedia, this is notifying the OS of a memory access violation.
